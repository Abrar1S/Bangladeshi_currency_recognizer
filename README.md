# Bangladeshi currency recognizer
• Using a Convolutional neural network to recognize Bangladesh currency(Bank notes).                                                                                     
• A custom CNN model and two pre-trained models were applied separately to understand the comparison.                                                           
• ResNet-50 and VGG16 are being used.                                                                                                                                     
• A Flask web app is also built to showcase how the recognizer works.
